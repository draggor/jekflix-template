# DooM

Every Sunday, at 5pm central, myself and a bunch of friends hop on a server to play classic DooM!  We do all sorts of maps and mods to keep things fresh, all while hanging out on the [draggetshow.com](https://draggetshow.wordpress.com/) discord server [here](https://discord.com/invite/xC8e35B).
